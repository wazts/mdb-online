# Rules

(Taken from the kickstarter)

So you wanna play a few rounds of MDB, huh? Well, gather up a few “friends,” prep your cringing muscles, and put on your best imagination cap. It’s time to get weird for a million dollars.

## Setup of the Game

Each player takes 4 black Trigger Cards and 4 gold Rule Cards. Put together, these cards create scenarios. Now, pick a judge from your group of friends. Maybe the person with the biggest feet?

## How to Play

Each player will hand a full scenario (remember, that's 1 black Trigger Card and 1 gold Rule Card), face-down, to the judge. See below for an example scenario.


One at a time, the judge will read the scenarios out loud to the group. This next part is where we think the fun of MDB lives. All players will attempt to glorify or downplay the scenarios, regardless of whether he/she put down that particular scenario. 

The judge will then pick the scenario they absolutely WOULD NOT do for a million bucks. The winner of that round is the new judge. 

Players then draw back up to 4 of each card type. (Always have 4 black Trigger Cards and 4 gold Rule Cards.)

## How to Win

Be the most depraved person on the planet.

No, but seriously. To be the overall winner, be the first player to win 5 rounds.

# Server Structure

We need a server that will have the rooms for people to gather. Each room will be 4 to 6 people. The rooms will all pull from the same list of cards.

We will represent each room with an ID and put the card decks into a Redis list store.
